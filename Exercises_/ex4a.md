# Exercise 4a

#### Start reviewing the materials related to getting started with R (see above).  Create two simple plots (they do not have to be maps) of any topic you want. 
#### Export the plots as a JPEG and then create a page describing what you did in either a ex4a.md or ex4a.html page linking to the images. 

## [Map 1](ex4a.map1)

## [Map 2](ex4a.map2)

## [Map 3](ex4a.map3)

## [R Code](ex4a.R)
