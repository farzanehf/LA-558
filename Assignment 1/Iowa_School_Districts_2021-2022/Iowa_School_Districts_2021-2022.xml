            <abstract>This dataset represents Iowa public school districts for the 2022-2023 school year.  Data is published to this feature service annually (or as needed), and boundaries for the prior year are archived to a separate static feature service by school year (i.e. Iowa School Districts 2019-2020).  The Department of Education, in coordination with local school districts
 and local county officials, have made ongoing efforts to update and correct school district boundaries
statewide since 2014. Except for school reorganizations, boundaries represented in this dataset supersede any prior 
years' data or any maps produced by any other source.  New boundary corrections are not applied retrospectively to archived datasets. This boundary layer represents legal school district boundaries, where 
possible; data is updated annually, or as needed.  Last update - 1/10/2022.Please contact the Iowa Department of Education for more information:
