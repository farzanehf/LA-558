# This is my Assignment 1 - ex3a file

## 
 
In the end this is what you need 

An html or .md file that provides a description of each of the maps and then links to a page with the actual map. If you decide to go with a .html file for this,
then you could combine all of the maps below in one file as embedded maps or links. But, I don't think you can do this with a markdown file. 

Map 1 is OpenStreetMap with a marker embedded on a web page titled assign3a.html 

Map 2 is an exported PDF map named assign3.pdf - note this is a good opportunity to make a map that uses a geoprocess, table join, or field calculation. 
You can describe what function you did in the html file that links to the PDF. Utilize a target="_blank" when you make the link to the PDF so it opens in a new 
browser tab. 

Your choice,  

export a map using the GIS2Web plugin,  

export a geoJSON file that only has the fields in the popup that you want to share,  

So I found a bug in option c, so instead you can modify the leaflet file I give you Thursday and just save it to your GitHub – See Thursday's Lecture video. 
However ,I have copied the code to a html file that you can also copy and place into your GitHub – or modify the example in JSBin and copy it into your own
html file. -  https://github.com/profSeeger/LA558_2023/blob/main/lecture/3bLeaflet.html
