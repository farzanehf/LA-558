# Exercise 4a

#### Start reviewing the materials related to getting started with R (see above).  Create two simple plots (they do not have to be maps) of any topic you want. 
#### Export the plots as a JPEG and then create a page describing what you did in either a ex4a.md or ex4a.html page linking to the images. 


#### These plots are for Iowa Crashes that the data reference is "https://data.iowadot.gov/datasets/IowaDOT::crash-data-sor/about"

## [Plot 1](ex4a.map1)

#### For the first plot I grouped the data by CRASH_YEAR and calculate the sum of each injury type.

## [Plot 2](ex4a.map2)

#### For the second plot I created a histogram of fatalities, colored by CRASH_YEAR and split by DRUGALCREL.

## [R Code](ex4a.R)
