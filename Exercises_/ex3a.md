# This is my Assignment 1 - ex3a file


An html or .md file that provides a description of each of the maps and then links to a page with the actual map. If you decide to go with a .html file for this,
then you could combine all of the maps below in one file as embedded maps or links. But, I don't think you can do this with a markdown file. 

## [Map 1](Assign3a.html)
# Map 1 is OpenStreetMap with a marker embedded on a web page titled


## [Map 2 an exported PDF map](ex3a-geopdf.pdf)
# Map 2 is an exported PDF map named assign3.pdf - note this is a good opportunity to make a map that uses a geoprocess, table join, or field calculation. 
You can describe what function you did in the html file that links to the PDF. Utilize a target="_blank" when you make the link to the PDF so it opens in a new 
browser tab.
## [Another try](Map.pdf)
- Map 2 is an exported PDF map for showing Iowa Wind Farms with two buffers in 4 miles and 8 miles. CWindturbines' colors are showing installation years

## Your choice:  

-export a map using the GIS2Web plugin,  

## [Map 3  geoJSON file](https://github.com/farzanehf/LA-558/blob/main/Exercises_/ex3a-JSON.geojson)
-export a geoJSON file that only has the fields in the popup that you want to share, 

- the other try
## [Map 3 is geoJSON file another one here](https://github.com/farzanehf/LA-558/blob/main/Exercises_/ex3a-JSON-edited by website.JSON)




- modify the leaflet file and place into your GitHub 
## [Map 4 is qgz file](https://github.com/farzanehf/LA-558/blob/main/Exercises_/ex3a-part4.qgz)

â€“ or modify the example in JSBin and copy it into your own html file. -  https://github.com/profSeeger/LA558_2023/blob/main/lecture/3bLeaflet.html
